# RCswitch
RCswithc is a plugin for smarthomeNG to send RC switch commands. With this plugin 433mhz remote controlled power plugs can be controlled from the smarthomeNG environment.

## plugin.conf
Adding the following lines to plungin.conf in smarthomeNG will enable the rcswitch plugin:
<pre>[rc]
    class_name = RCswitch
    class_path = plugins.rcswitch
    rcswitch_dir = {path of rc switch} # optional parameter. Default: /etc/local/bin/rcswitch-pi
    rcswitch_sendDuration = {minimum time in s between sending commands} # optional parameter. Default: 0.5
</pre>
## items.conf
Just add following attributes to the items which shall be connected with rcswitch:
<pre>
rc_device = number of device [1-5]
rc_code = code of device [00000 - 11111]
</pre>

## Necessary Hardware
- RaspberryPi or any other board wich has digital GPIO
- [433 Mhz transmitter](https://www.google.de/search?q=433+mhz+transmitter&client=opera&hs=aeh&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjzsYKo7vHRAhXKWxoKHdk1D6YQ_AUICSgC&biw=1163&bih=589)
- 433 Mhz controlled power plug, e.g. Brennenstuhl RCS 1000 N

Connect the VCC of the 433Mhz transmitter to any 5V output pin of your board, the GND to a ground pin and the ATAD to any GPIO pin. In this example we use  pin 17. I reccomend also to connect a (long) cable to the ANT pin of the 433Mhz transmitter - this extends the range of the sender.

## Installation of 3rd party software
The plugin depends on two 3rd party software packages:
- wiringPi
- rcswitch-pi

### Installation of wiringPi:
In case not already done, update the system and install git:
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git-core
</pre>
Then download wiringPi to /usr/local/bin/wiringPi
<pre>
cd /usr/local/bin
sudo git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
</pre>
and install it:
<pre>
cd wiringPi
sudo ./build
</pre>

### Installation of rcswitch-pi
Download the sources into /etc/local/bin/rcswitch-pi:
<pre>
cd /usr/local/bin
sudo git clone https://github.com/r10r/rcswitch-pi.git
</pre>
Before building rcswitch-pi, the port has to be defineded the the code has to be slightly changed. Therefore edit the file send.cpp and the change the port to your needs and replace the command wiringPiSetup() to wiringPiSetupSys(). For editing the file:
<pre>
cd rcswitch-pi
sudo nano send.cpp
</pre>
In our example the file send.cpp has to look like follwos:
<pre>
int PIN = 17;
  char* systemCode = argv[1];
  int unitCode = atoi(argv[2]);
  int command = atoi(argv[3]);

  if (wiringPiSetupSys() == -1) return 1;
     printf("sending systemCode[%s] unitCode[%i] command[%i]\n", systemCode, unitCode, command);
     RCSwitch mySwitch = RCSwitch();
     mySwitch.enableTransmit(PIN);

  switch(command) {
      case 1:
          mySwitch.switchOn(systemCode, unitCode);
          break;
      case 0:
          mySwitch.switchOff(systemCode, unitCode);
          break;
      default:
</pre>
Save the file (ctrl + o) and leave nano (ctrl+x)
Now rcswitch pi can be compiled:
<pre>
cd rcswitch-pi
make
</pre>

##Send as non-root and testing
For a first basic test, write access to non-root users can be granted with the command:
<pre>gpio export 17 out</pre>
Now, with the send command the power plugs can be swithed. Assuming, the power plug has code 11111 and address 2 (=B), the command to switch it on is:
<pre>./send 11111 2 1</pre>
If the power plug does not switch at this point, you need to figure out why before proceeding.

Because the setting of port 17, done with the command 'gpio export 17 out' will be lost after reboot, it has to made persistent. Therefore create file /usr/local/scripts/exportGPIO17
<pre>sudo mkdir /usr/local/scripts/
cd /usr/local/scripts/
sudo nano exportGPIO17
</pre>
and add the following content:
<pre>#!/bin/sh  
echo "17" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/direction
chmod 666 /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/value
chmod 666 /sys/class/gpio/gpio17/direction</pre>
Save and close the file. Now the file has to be made executeable with
<pre>sudo sudo chmod +x exportGPIO17</pre>
Last step is to ensure that the file is called during system boot. Therefore add the following  line has to be added to /etc/rc.local, right before the 'exit 0' command:
<pre>/usr/local/scripts/exportGPIO17</pre>
Now even after reboot it sould be possible to switch the power plungs with the rcswitch-pi 'send' command.
